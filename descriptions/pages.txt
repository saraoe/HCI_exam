The app consists of 4 stages:
- Upload documents
- Anonymization options
- Assess documents
- Download documents

Firstly, you must *upload documents* and chose the right *anonymization options*. Then you *assess* the 
anonymization with the possibility of manually changing the annotations. When each document is
anonymized correctly, you can save the document using the button underneath the anonymized text. You also have the possibility to simply save all 
annotations the model has made without any assessment. 
When all anonymized documents have been saved you can *download* them on the last page.

You can always go back and forth between the different stages by using the menu on the left.
