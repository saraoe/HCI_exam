**HIanonymize** is a free to use, open-source app for anonymizing text data using Hybrid Intelligence (HI). 
The app relies on [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for the automatic identification and anonymization of named entites while
letting the user manually assess and update the annotations and anonymization options.
The app is developed to afford an interactive interplay between the AI and the user by affording 
live-feedback of any user changes. By doing so, we are aiming to support optimal anonymization of text data.
