**HIanonymize** is a free to use, open-source app for anonymizing text data using Hybrid Intelligence (HI). 
The app relies on [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for identifying and anonymizing named entites while
still letting the user manually assess and update the annotations.
The app is developed to afford an interactive interplay between the AI and the user by affording 
live-feedback of any user changes. By doing so, we are aiming to enforce optimal anonymization of text data.
