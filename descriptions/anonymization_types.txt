You can choose between two anonymization types:

- **Context preserving anonymization**:
This type of anonymization keeps information about the word type.
E.g. *"Orwell is an excellent writer"* -> *"[NAME] is an excellent writer!"*
- **Non-context preserving anonymization**:
This type of anonymization excludes information about the word type.
E.g.*"Orwell is an excellent writer"* -> *"[XXX] is an excellent writer!"*
